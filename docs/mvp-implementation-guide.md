## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities)
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini for language processing and embeddings
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for knowledge base storage and retrieval
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state

### Database Schema

#### Core Tables
1. **users** - Extended user profiles with learning preferences
2. **questions** - Question bank with metadata and explanations
3. **user_answers** - Answer history with performance data
4. **user_sessions** - Learning session tracking
5. **mistake_questions** - Smart mistake book with spaced repetition
6. **ai_conversations** - Chat history with context preservation
7. **knowledge_base** - RAG knowledge entries with vector IDs

#### Key Relationships
- Users have many sessions, answers, and mistakes
- Questions can be in multiple mistake books
- AI conversations link to specific questions and users
- Knowledge base entries map to vector embeddings

### AI/ML Components

#### RAG System
```typescript
// Core RAG workflow
1. User asks question
2. Generate query embedding using Gemini
3. Search similar knowledge in Pinecone
4. Retrieve full context from Supabase
5. Generate personalized response with Gemini
6. Save conversation for future context
```

#### Mistake Book Algorithm
```typescript
// Spaced repetition intervals
Mastery Level 0 (New): Review in 1 day
Mastery Level 1 (Learning): Review in 3 days
Mastery Level 2 (Review): Review in 7 days
Mastery Level 3 (Mastered): Review in 30 days
```
